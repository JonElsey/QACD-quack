# QACD-quack
This is a repository for Quack, a software method for the processing and handling of element (X-ray) maps collected by SEM EDS analysis. The Quack software incorporates a technique for the quantitative assessment of compositional distributions (QACD) within geological materials. Though this method has initially been developed with a focus on mafic to intermediate igneous rocks, we hope that users will make use of the open-source nature of this software to modify and adapt it to suit their own research. We encourage those users who do end up making their own modifications or new modules to submit them for integration into the project. Any suggestions for bug fixes or new modules are welcome as this software is in its earliest of development stages.

Thank you for your interest,
